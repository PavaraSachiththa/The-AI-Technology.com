             <p> <li> There are those of us who clean once a week, and there are those of us who clean when the in-laws come to visit. The appeal of the robotic vacuum 
                 reaches both camps. Either way, the house is a bit more spotless with minimal human input.Today’s Artificial Intelligence robotic vacuums are a
                 far cry from the first models. That you had to track down, stranded somewhere in your house, by their melancholy, “I’m out of power” beeping. </p>
             <p> <li> The latest products clean your house, remember the layout to increase efficiency. Also, dump their own dirt in a receptacle and find their way 
                 back to the charging station so they can rejoice. </p>

                      surgeons, patrol hostile skies and even drive around town. They grow up so fast, don’t they The robotics field continues to worm its way
                      into every aspect of our lives. Although, these advancements aren’t self-sustaining. The fields of robotics, engineering, and science depend
                      on young minds.
